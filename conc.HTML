		<h1>The conclusion</h1>
		<p  style="font-size:20px"> Big Data Analytics is a security enhancing tool of the future. The amount of information that can be gathered, organized, and applied to users in a personalized fashion would take a human, days, weeks, or even months to accomplish. In the capitalistic market such as the United States of Americaâ€™s, competition is key. Time cannot be wasted gathering information and making decisions on incidents that have already taken place. Stopping incidents in their tracks, completing investigative work, and quarantining threatening sources needs to happen immediately and allow for administrators/management to make a on the spot decision. With big data analytics, more educated decisions can be made and focus can remain on business operations moving forward. </p>
